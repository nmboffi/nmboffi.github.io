<!--##### about me -->
# nicholas m. boffi

I am a sixth-year PhD student in applied mathematics at Harvard University, where I am co-advised by [Chris Rycroft](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr/research/) (Harvard) and [Jean-Jacques Slotine](http://web.mit.edu/nsl/www/) (MIT). I am also a student researcher at Google Brain Robotics, where I am hosted by [Vikas Sindhwani](https://vikas.sindhwani.org/). 

Before attending Harvard, I was an undergraduate at Northwestern University, where I was a triple major in mathematics, physics, and [integrated science](https://isp.northwestern.edu/). I was advised by [Tamar Seideman](https://sites.northwestern.edu/seideman/). From 2014-2015, I was a Fulbright Scholar at Tel Aviv University, where I was hosted by Amir Natan. 

From 2015-2018, my research was funded by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship.

I can be reached at boffi at g.harvard.edu.

##### research interests

I am broadly interested in nonlinear dynamical systems, control theory, machine learning, optimization, numerical analysis, and computational mathematics. My recent research has focused on the use of machine learning methods in control theory, and the application of dynamical systems techniques to optimization and machine learning. In the past, I have focused on numerical algorithm development for the simulation of physical systems, both quantum and classical.
