<img src="../images/me_elizabeth_park.jpg" width="350" align="right" style="padding: 15px">

I am a Courant Instructor / Assistant Professor of applied mathematics at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.courant.nyu.edu/), where I work primarily with [Eric Vanden-Eijnden](https://wp.nyu.edu/courantinstituteofmathematicalsciences-eve2/). I completed my PhD at Harvard University in applied mathematics, where I was advised by [Chris Rycroft](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr/research/) and [Jean-Jacques Slotine](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TcREpMQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (MIT). During the last year of my PhD, I was also a student researcher at Google Brain, where I worked primarily with [Vikas Sindhwani](https://vikas.sindhwani.org/) and [Stephen Tu](https://stephentu.github.io). From 2015-2019, my research was funded by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF).

Before graduate school, I was an undergraduate at Northwestern University, where I studied mathematics, physics, and [integrated science](https://isp.northwestern.edu/). I spent four wonderful years working on problems in theoretical chemistry with [Tamar Seideman](https://sites.northwestern.edu/seideman/). From 2014-2015, I was a Fulbright Scholar at Tel Aviv University, focusing on the development of numerical methods for quantum chemistry.

I can be reached at boffi at cims dot nyu dot edu.

##### research interests
I am an applied and computational mathematician. I am currently interested in understanding how the successes of neural networks in domains such as image recognition, strategic games, and robotics can be brought to problems in scientific computing and computational mathematics. My research draws on techniques from numerical analysis, dynamical systems, probability, high-dimensional statistics, and optimization to design, implement, and demonstrate the effectiveness of new algorithms with provable guarantees. In the past, I have worked on numerical methods for simulating disordered, biological, and quantum systems, as well as online learning algorithms for real-time control of dynamical systems.
