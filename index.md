I am a Courant Instructor / Assistant Professor of applied mathematics at the [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.courant.nyu.edu/), where I work primarily with [Eric Vanden-Eijnden](https://wp.nyu.edu/courantinstituteofmathematicalsciences-eve2/). I completed my PhD at Harvard University in applied mathematics, advised by [Jean-Jacques Slotine](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TcREpMQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) (MIT) and [Chris Rycroft](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr/research/). During the last year of my PhD, I was also a student researcher at Google Brain, where I had the pleasure of working with [Vikas Sindhwani](https://vikas.sindhwani.org/) and [Stephen Tu](https://stephentu.github.io). From 2015-2019, my research was funded by a Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF); I spent my practicum at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

Before graduate school, I was an undergraduate at Northwestern University, where I studied mathematics, physics, and [integrated science](https://isp.northwestern.edu/). I spent four wonderful years working on problems in theoretical chemistry with [Tamar Seideman](https://sites.northwestern.edu/seideman/). From 2014-2015, I was a Fulbright Scholar at Tel Aviv University, focusing on the development of numerical methods for quantum chemistry.

## research interests
I am an applied and computational mathematician. I am currently interested in understanding how the successes of neural networks in domains such as image recognition, strategic games, and robotics can be brought to high-dimensional problems in scientific computing and computational mathematics. My research draws on techniques from numerical analysis, dynamical systems, probability, and optimization to design, implement, and analyze new algorithms with provable guarantees. 

In the past, my work in scientific computing has been focused on method development for simulating disordered, biological, and quantum systems, while my work in machine learning has centered on the study of online learning algorithms for real-time control of dynamical systems.
