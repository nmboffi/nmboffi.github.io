<h2 id="research" style="margin-top: 2.5rem;">Research Group</h2>

<p>The goal of our group is to develop a mathematical theory of generative artificial intelligence and to demonstrate that the resulting techniques can solve scientific problems previously thought intractable. We design <strong><em>simple and elegant</em></strong> algorithmic frameworks that <strong><em>elucidate</em></strong> why existing approaches work, <strong><em>reveal</em></strong> principled new methods, and <strong><em>scale</em></strong> to achieve state-of-the-art performance in practice.</p>

<p>Questions we are currently studying include:</p>

<details class="research-details">
  <summary><strong>Foundations of generative modeling:</strong> <em>Why do flow and diffusion models work so well, and how do we move beyond the current paradigm?</em></summary>
  <div class="research-details-content">
    <p>In this direction, we have developed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><em>Stochastic interpolants</em></strong>, a mathematical framework that unifies and underlies modern flow and diffusion models</li>
      <li><strong><em>Flow maps</em></strong>, a theory of accelerated generative models that explains and extends consistency models</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Current topics of interest include controlled generation, fine-tuning, inference-time guidance, accelerated sampling, and discrete generation.</p>

<details class="research-details">
  <summary><strong>Generative models for science and engineering:</strong> <em>How can we solve scientific problems that are fundamentally impossible with traditional computational techniques?</em></summary>
  <div class="research-details-content">
    <p>We pursue applications in physics, chemistry, biology, vision, and robotics. In each case, we collaborate closely with domain experts to ensure we are solving real problems, as well as targeting challenges that could not be addressed with known domain-specific tools.

    In this direction, we have developed:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Methods for <strong><em>entropy production estimation</em></strong> in non-equilibrium systems that scale to tens of thousands of dimensions</li>
      <li>A <strong><em>critical analysis of generative policies</em></strong> in robotic control, showing they work for different reasons than commonly understood</li>
      <li>Methods for <strong><em>accelerated generative modeling over geometric data</em></strong>, combining flow maps with Riemannian geometry for proteins and molecules</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Current topics of interest include 3D shape generation, molecular sampling, scientific inverse problems, and rare event estimation in complex dynamical systems.</p>

</details>

<p>Beyond our core methodological work, we are early adopters of AI tools and are excited about a future of scientific research deeply integrated with AI. We investigate new ways to leverage language models and agentic automation to dramatically accelerate the pace of research within our group and beyond.</p>
