# code
Below are some pieces of open source software that I've written, listed in reverse-chronological order. 

The latest code is mostly based on neural network libraries in Python such as `jax` and `PyTorch`, with applications in high-dimensional scientific computing and generative modeling. 

The earlier code is written in `C++` (or even `FORTRAN`) and is parallelized with `openmp` or `MPI`, with applications in large-scale modeling and simulation of disordered systems from statistical physics and continuum mechanics.
